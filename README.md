# About me

My name is Derek, and I'm a graduate student working towards a PhD in nuclear physics. I'm learning to use GitHub so I can better keep track of the changes I make to the code used for my analysis as well as keep a safe backup of what I've written.

I might also put some other projects on here too! (But I do kinda suck at programming, so don't expect anything too spectacular lol.)
